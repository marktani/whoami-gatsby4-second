## Radical Change

The last few years of my life has been filled with external and internal change.
I moved to another city, I've been travelling to places I've never been before. Many of my base assumptions about life got challenged.

**I went through a lot of change.** And yet, eventually, I seem to always end up experiencing the same feeling within me.

## My Changes

In the recent years, I have experienced change again and again.

I moved to another city. Relationships ended. New relationships started. I lost loved ones. I quit my job. I've travelled new continents. I've worked in different setups. I've explored new interests. I made new experiences.

I identified and detached from many core beliefs that I had about life and myself.

## Am I wrong?

No matter what changes I've been going through, there is one experience I am making, one conclusion I have that keeps coming back. It is a certain feeling that is still difficult for me to describe and comprehend.

It feels very uncomfortable. When I have this feeling, I feel a mix of fear, anxiety and incompleteness. And, I feel so _wrong_. No matter what I do, no matter what I try, I can't get rid of this feeling. **Am I wrong?**

## Breaking the cycle

I am trying to understand this feeling, and eventually not feel it anymore.

For the most part of my life, I thought that this feeling primarily stems from my external situation. After having gone through so many vastly different external situations, however, I have now come to the conclusion that this is not true.

**I believe that there is a fundamental cause for this feeling, and that I can find it within me.**

I don't know who I am. I think, this feeling is connected to my lack of identity. To a large extend, this feeling _is_ my identity.

I will find myself. I will break the cycle. I will go through radical change.
