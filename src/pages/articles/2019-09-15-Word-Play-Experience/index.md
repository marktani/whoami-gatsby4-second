description: "My experience and experience with the word experience"
---

My experience with the word "experience" in the English language is in stark contrast to my experience with its German counterparts (!) - namely Erlebnis and Erfahrung.

Talking about those concepts is one of the cases (that is: not the only one) where both of these is true:
* I can express myself very accurately and in a nuanced fashion in German,
* I struggle to do so in English.

## A fine distinction

While to me the distinction between Erfahrung and Erlebnis is crucial and of high interest, in English I mostly use the word _experience_ for both, which leads to the loss of that very same distinction.

* Erfahrung  
  1. practical contact with and observation of facts or events.  
  2. an event or occurrence which leaves an impression on someone.

* Erlebenope

Here is a list of words and phrases that I often use in German, and the best translation I currently know in English. To highlight my point, I put the word **experience** in bold.



  * Eine Erfahrung machen - to make an **experience**  
    > Welche Erfahrungen hast du bereits mit KundengesprÃ¤chen gemacht?  
    > Which **experience**s did you already make with customer conversations?  
  * Erfahrung haben - to have **experience**, someone's **experience**  
    > Du hast viel Erfahrung mit Tieren.  
    > You have a lot of **experience** with animals.  
    >
    > Welche bisherigen Erfahrungen hast du im Bereich Softwareentwicklung?  
    > What is your previous **experience** in the area of software development?  
  * erfahren sein - to be **experience**  
    > Wie erfahren bist du im Bereich Softwareentwicklung?  
    > How **experience**d are you in the area of software development?  

* Erleben
  * Etwas erleben - to **experience** something  
    > Wie hast du das erlebt?  
    > How did you **experience** that?  
  * Mein Erleben - my **experience**  
    > Was war dein Erleben damit?  
    > What was your **experience** with that?  
  * Das Erlebte - that which is **experience**d  
    > --  
  * Das Erlebnis - the **experience**  
    > Was war dein Erlebnis von diesem Ereignis?  
    > How was your **experience** of that event?  
  * etwas erleben - to **experience** something  
    > Wie hast du dieses Ereignis erlebt?  
    > How did you **experience** that event?  

## An experienced lack of relevance

Curiously enough, while consulting an English-German/German-English dictionary for this _thought rag_ [Gedankenfetzen], I stumbled across this question and subsequent discussion: [Welche Erfahrungen hast du in China gemacht / gesammelt?](https://dict.leo.org/forum/viewUnsolvedquery.php?idThread=1218074). In this forum thread, user `captain flint` (presumable a native English speaker) makes the following comment:

```
Forget "experience", and ask something like:

How did you find China?
What did you think of China?
What was it like in China?
How did you find living/working/doing business in China?

... or just ask them whether they enjoyed it.

Although you might say that, for example, "John had some bad experiences when he was in China", you wouldn't usually ask people directly about their "experiences" in another country.
```

I resonate heavily with this comment, namely as follows:

1. > Forget "experience", and ask something like:

  No, I won't forget about "experience". I have experiences, I talk about them and I am curious about the experiences of others.

2. > How did you find China?
> What did you think of China?
> What was it like in China?
> How did you find living/working/doing business in China?
>
> ... or just ask them whether they enjoyed it.

  There are cases where none of those are _exactly_ what I'm interested in, but their _experience_ is exactly what I'm interested in. And vice versa there are cases where I am interested in specifically sharing my _experience_ about something, and not how I did find/think of/like it etc. A fine distinction.

3. > Although you might say that, for example, "John had some bad experiences when he was in China", you wouldn't usually ask people directly about their "experiences" in another country.
  
  Why wouldn't you usually ask someone about their "experiences" in another country? I would.
