## Turning 30

Today is 30th birthdays. That makes 30 turns around the sun.

Building my foundation. There are many days where I feel down.

I finally know why I've felt shitty for large parts of my life. I've done the work. I've threw myself into this life.
The things with life is that once you start living, it keeps growing intense. It's not your job to make sure it does.
Your focus needs to be on becoming the best you can, so you can handle yourself and life.

I know I have a long way in front of me. But I've been coming all this way to continue, and grow into my best version.
Now more than ever.

## Growing Up

I am proud about making it this far. I am proud to release my poem collection [GROWING UP](/growing-up).

## Regrets

I regret 

I forgave myself and people in my life.

## Fundamentals and Basic

It's all about sticking to the fundamentals. Taking full ownership over my life. Reminding myself again and again that acceptance, gratitude, authenticity, self-responsibility, equanimity is the way.

## Seeking truth

In poetry I've found my voice, and in playing Setar I've found my tune.
I am seeking for truth in everything.

I am grateful to everyone in my life.
Everyone I met gave me the opportunity to learn more about my truth and the truth of the world.

I am looking forward to many more decades ahead. Finally I feel like I'm on the right path.
