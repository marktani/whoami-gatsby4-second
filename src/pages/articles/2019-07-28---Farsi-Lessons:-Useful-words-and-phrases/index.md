description: "Here I am collecting useful words and phrases in Farsi."
---

Currently I am watching [Prophet Joseph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prophet_Joseph_(TV_series)), an Iranian TV series (سِریال _/seriāl/_), in Farsi with English subtitles. This helps me to improve my listening comprehension and to expand my Farsi vocabulary.

Here I am collecting useful words and phrases in Farsi that I pick up from the show or elsewhere.

> Words between two slashes are a phonetic representation of the Farsi words, loosely based on the [IPA romanization of Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Persian).

## Commands

Verbs in sentences that are commands or suggestions are written in [imperative form](http://www.jahanshiri.ir/fa/en/imperative).
For example the verb کَردَن _/kardan/_ (to do) in its imperative form 2nd person singular is کُن _/kon/_.

* !بیا اینجا  
_/biā injā/_  
Come here!  

  Command. بیا _/biā/_ is spoken Farsi for the imperative form of آمَدَن _/āmadan/_ (to come) in second person singular. In written Farsi, it is بیایی _/biāii/_, a combination of
    * the prefix indicating the imperative form - typically, verbs in this form start with either بُـ _/bo/_ or بِـ _/be/_, but in for آمَدَن _/āmadan/_ it is بیـ _/bi/_ -,
    * the [present stem](/posts/farsi-verbs-basics/) آی _/āy/_ of آمَدَن _/āmadan/_, and
    * the [personal ending](/posts/farsi-verbs-basics/) for the second person singular, ی _/-i/_.

* بَس _/bas/_  
enough
* !بَس کُن  
_/bas kon/_  
Stop (it)!

  Command. From کَردَن _/kardan/_ (to do).

* !بِرَویم  
_/beravim/_  
Let's go!

  Suggestion. From رَفتَن _/raftan/_ (to go).

## Questions

A large part of learning more about the world, and a specific language, is to ask questions.

* کی؟  
_/ki/_  
who?

  For example, این **کی** اَست؟ /in ki ast/ (who is this?). In spoken Farsi, it's common to say این کیست ؟ _/in kist/_ instead.

* کُجا؟  
_/kojā/_  
where?

  For example, کُجا هَستی؟ _/kojā hasti/_, or in spoken Farsi کُجای؟ _/kojāi/_.

* کِی؟  
_/key/_  
when?

  If omitting the short vowel ِ , کِی _/key/_ is written exactly as کی _/ki/_.

* چِرا؟
_/tscherā/_  
why?

  The counter "because" is چون _/tschon/_.

## Exclamations and expressions

* بر عکس  
_/bar aks/_, _/ber aks/_  
on the contrary

  Here I am not sure if it is pronounced _/bar/_ or _/ber/_, or if both variants are used.

* !اَلبَتّه  
_/albatte/_  
Of course!

* مَثَلاً  
_/mazalan/_  
for example

  The letter combination اً can only appear at the end of a word, it is then pronounced _/an/_. The character/this concept is called تَنوِين‎ _/tanvin/_ or [nunation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nunation). The word "nunation" comes from the letter ن ـ/noon/_.

* مِثل  
_/mezl/_  
like

* !آفَرین  
_/āfarin/_  
Well done!, Exactly!, Good job!

* !خَستِه نَباشی  
_/khaste nabāʃi/_  
Literally: 'Don't get tired!'

  Usually used as a greeting or farewell, expresses the appreciation for the work someone is doing (often in this very moment). For example, entering a bakery, you could say خَستِه نَباشی _/khaste nabāʃi/_ to the baker as a greeting.

* !نِگَران نَباشی  
_/negarān nabāʃi/_  
Don't worry!

  Because the infinite of "to worry" is نِگَرانی بودَن _/negarāni budan/_ (literally: to be worry), the imperative form uses باشی _/bāʃi/_. So, in English you _do_ worry, in Farsi you _are_ worry. By the way, in German you "make yourself worry" (to worry is reflexive in German).

* کَمِ کَم  
_/kame kam/_  
little by little

  For example, !کَمِ کَم یاد می گیری _/kame kam yād migiri/_ (You learn little by little!).

* آمَده  
_/āmadeh/_  
ready, done

  From آمَدن _/āmadan/_, to come. "arrived" (participle), as in 'The food is ready, it has arrived at its desired state'.

* هَمیشهِ  
_/hamishe/_  
forever

* هَرگِز  
_/hargez/_  
never

* گاهی  
_/gāhi/_  
sometimes

  Synonym: بَعضی وَقت‌ها _/b'azi vaghthā/_

* !دوبارِه بِگو  
_/dobāreh begu/_  
say it again!

  When you didn't understand someone.

* از قَدیم تا ُکنون
_/az qadimi tā konun/_
since old times until now

## Vocabulary

interesting

  Adjective.

  Adjective. The suffix ـتَر _/-tar/_ signifies the comparative form of adjectives, while the suffix ـتَرین _/-tarin/_ signifies the superlative form. بِهتَر _/behtar/_ and بِهتَرین _/behtarin/_ (the best) are usually used for the adjective خوب _/khoob/_ (good).

  تَمام شُد _/tamām ʃod/_ can be used when something is over, done or ready. For example, when kids are finished with a game, or when speaking about that the construction of a building is done. تَمام _/tamām/_ means whole/complete, the infinitive is تَمام شُدَن _/tamām ʃodan/_.
