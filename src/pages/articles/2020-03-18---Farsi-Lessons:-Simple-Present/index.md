In this lesson you will learn about the simple present tense in Farsi.
It is more difficult to conjugate than the [Simple Past](/posts/farsi-simple-past),
let's have a look at how it works! 😊 

> Words between two slashes are a phonetic representation of the Farsi words, loosely based on the [IPA romanization of Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Persian).

## Reminder: Building Blocks

As we learned in the lesson [Verb Basics](/posts/farsi-verbs-basics/), there are various **building blocks** that we can use when working with verbs in Farsi.

We need three building blocks to form verbs in the **simple present**:

* The **present stem**
* The **personal endings**
* The **particle** می _/mi/_

## Forming the Simple Present

Unlike the past stem, the present stem **cannot** be derived directly from a verb's infinitive.
This is why it is recommended to **learn the infinitive together with the present stem** when memorizing a new verb in Farsi! 💡

Let's conjugate the verb دیدَن _/didan/_ as an example. We need the **present stem** بین _/bin/_, the **personal endings** and the **particle** می _/mi/_.

> Review the lesson on [Farsi Verb Basics](/posts/farsi-verbs-basics/) for an overview of the personal endings!

With the present stem and the personal ending in hand, we can now form the verb by simply combining them:

* **verb in simple present** = **particle** می _/mi/_ + **present stem** + **personal ending**

This the resulting conjugation for دیدَن _/didan/_:

|Simple Present|      Pronoun|
|---|---|
|میبینَم |مَن|
|_/mibinam/_|_/man/_|
|میبینی |تو|
|_/mibini/_|_/to/_|
|میبینَد |او|
|_/mibinad/_|_/u/_|
|**---**|**---**|
|میبینیم |ما|
|_/mibinim/_|_/mā/_|
|میبینید |شُما|
|_/mibinid/_|_/ʃomā/_|
|میبینَند |آن‌ها|
|_/mibinand/_|_/ānhā/_|

Here are more examples of verbs and their present stems:

* بودَن _/budan/_ → هَست _/hast/_
* داشتَن _/dāʃtan/_ → دار _/dār/_
* آمَدَن _/āmadan/_ → آی _/āy/_
* رَفتَن _/raftan/_ → رَو _/rav/_
* شِنیدَن _/ʃenidan/_ → شِنَو _/ʃenav/_

And some more conjugation examples:

* او میایَد _/u miāyad/_ = He/She comes
* آن‌ها هَستَند _/ānhā hastand/_ = They are

Remember that you need to learn the **present stem** of a verb alongside its **infinitive**, because it cannot be derived 💡

## Summary

Forming the **simple present** in Farsi requires the knowledge of the present stem, the personal endings, and a particle.
