## Curiosity about individual stories

I posses an undepletable amount of curiosity. I am particularly curious about humans. That is, humanity in general including culture, languages, psychology and history. But also individual human stories.

## A pattern in my life

There is a pattern in my life, that I cannot give a particular name yet.

So why do I call this a pattern then? For one, it happened many times already. Sometimes, this is not with a few people either; then it's about me in the context of communities that can be big by the thousands. What's more, this dynamic is not something I actively or knowingly _seek_ - it somehow _just happens_. Up until very recently, I have not even been aware of this pattern. **Somehow, this pattern finds me wherever I go**!

Let me try to describe it with the following examples.

## Engaging in human connection

I must have been **about 5 years old** when my brother collected stickers of football players from the Bundesliga. He managed to finish the entire booklet in that particular year. Somehow, I had learned all player names by heart, and could recite their jersey number and the club they're playing for.

**In highschool**, I loved to engage in conversations with students of other classes in the breaks. Over the years, I talked to several hundreds of students. I knew their names, which class they're in, I greeted them in the hallway. From many, I knew about their interests, their struggles and themselves - and in turn they did know me.

For about a decade, I've played [Soldat](https://soldat.pl/en/), **a video game** with a global community that was quite active back then. I actively participated in the community and spent countless of hours ingame and in audio and video chats with other dozens of players from all over the world. We shared personal stories, struggles and jokes, and had a ton of fun together. Four years ago, I joined a gathering of Soldat players in Berlin with about ten attendees from Germany, Poland, the Netherlands and Finland (!). I've made real friends across the globe, that know some parts of me better than most of my local friends.

For **my first real job**, I joined [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) as the first employee. I tried out a lot of different positions and was involved with pretty much every part of the company at some point. I spent more and more time chatting with customers and members of the community that was beginning to grow. Helping with their problems, listening to their feedback and answering their questions. Over more than two and a half years, I met literally thousands of people online, on the phone and in person.

## A recent touching encounter

Apart from these examples, there are many individual encounters that _just happen to me_. I've shared some of them in my recent blog post **Tonight**, and further below you can find another recent encounter that really touched me.

## It's not you, it's me

Think about it! I live through an experience again and again; I experience a certain pattern in my life, in varying contexts, over many years. At home, in school, at work or when playing video games - maybe _it's not about them_. **This is about me**.

## Connecting with new people

Meeting new people brings me pure joy. I sometimes struggle with approaching persons that I don't know or recently met and even sometimes persons I know for a long time.
Whether or not I struggle can be very situational depending on the environment, the persons themselves, and my current mood.

However, there are settings that support connecting on a deeper lever, and such that interfere with true connection.
