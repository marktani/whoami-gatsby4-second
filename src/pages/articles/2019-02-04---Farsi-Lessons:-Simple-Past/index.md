In this Farsi lesson you can learn how to conjugate verbs in the simple past. As we'll see, this tense is very easy to build in Farsi! 😊 

> Words between two slashes are a phonetic representation of the Farsi words, loosely based on the [IPA romanization of Persian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Romanization_of_Persian).

## Reminder: Building Blocks

As a reminder, in the last lesson [Verb Basics](/posts/farsi-verbs-basics/) we took a look at various **building blocks** that we can use when working with verbs in Farsi.

We need two building blocks to form verbs in the **simple past**:

* The **past stem**
* The **personal endings**

## Forming the Simple Past

Let's conjugate the verb رَفتَن _/raftan/_ as an example. We need the **past stem** رَفت _/raft/_ and the **personal endings**.

> Review the [previous lesson](/posts/farsi-verbs-basics/) for an overview of the personal endings!

With the past stem and the personal ending in hand, we can now form the verb by simply combining them:

* **verb in simple past** = **past stem** + **personal ending**

Because the past stem can be derived directly from a verb's infinitive, conjugating verbs in the simple past is very simple! 💡

This the resulting conjugation for رَفتَن _/raftan/_:

|Simple Past|      Pronoun|
|---|---|
|رَفتَم َ|مَن|
|_/raftam/_|_/man/_|
|رَفتی |تو|
|_/rafti/_|_/to/_|
|رَفتَد |او|
|_/raftad/_|_/u/_|
|**---**|**---**|
|رَفتیم |ما|
|_/raftim/_|_/mā/_|
|رَفتید |شُما|
|_/raftid/_|_/ʃomā/_|
|رَفتَند |آن‌ها|
|_/raftand/_|_/ānhā/_|

---

Here are more examples:

* مَن داشتَم _/man dāʃtam/_ = I had
* او آمَد _/u āmad/_ = He/She came
* آن‌ها بودَند _/ānhā budand/_ = They were

Remember that you can derive the **past stem** from a verb's **infinitive** by removing the ending «ن َ-» _/-an/_ 💡

## Summary

Forming the **simple past** in Farsi is very simple when you're familiar with the [Verb Basics](/posts/farsi-verbs-basics/). Combine the **past stem** with the **personal ending** and that's it!
