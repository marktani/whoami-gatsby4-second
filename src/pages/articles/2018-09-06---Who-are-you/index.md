description: "'Who are you?' is a question I cannot answer. But I'm finding it out."

Who are you?

They will call you names.

> What's your name,
> and the name of your game?

They will insult your roots.

> Where are you from,
> and do you call it home?

They will taunt your intellect.

> What's your education,
> and is it your occupation?

They will tear at your heart, but they can never take _who you are_.

Who are you if not what you do,
what you hide and what you show,
what you seek and what you know,
what you dream and where you go?

**Find out who you are by becoming who you want to be.**
