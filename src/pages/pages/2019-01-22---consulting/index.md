I believe that **empathy**, **authenticity**, and **open-mindedness** are crucial for the success of any individual, company or product. Based on these values and my unique expertise, I support companies in various ways.

As a **consultant**, I offer my insights at the intersection of customer success, software development, community engagement, customer support, product management and content marketing. I challenge startup founders to be bold and believe in their vision and strengths, while being authentic and honest.

As a **teacher**, I share my knowledge using blog posts, tutorials, technical documentation, and workshops about customer success & software development. I strive to [embrace the beginner's mind](/posts/embracing-the-beginners-mind/).

As a **software developer**, I build applications with a focus on UX, testing & QA.

## Selected Clients
