Some past projects I'm proud of:

* At [rideOS](https://rideos.ai), I am building software to efficiently move people and things throughout the world, and I'm helping our partners and customers in the automotive, self-driving car and ridehailing industries to use it.

* I grew the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) community from scratch to several thousand active members and tens of thousands of customers - [here's what they say about me](https://www.prisma.io/forum/t/thank-you-nilan/2436?u=nilan).

* At [XChange](https://xchange.eco/) as interim CTO, I helped building a startup ecosystem based on collaboration.

* My articles have been published on [CSS Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/declarative-data-fetching-graphql/), [Auth0](https://auth0.com/blog/building-an-instagram-clone-with-graphql-and-auth0/) and other platforms.

* I implemented the app for [Optonaut](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ok1bNOsGh60) in Android and OpenGL and was responsible for the quality assurance of all software libraries at [Prisma](https://github.com/prisma/) for almost three years.

* I have created a wide range of blog articles and learning resources in the area of software development, like [Learn Relay](https://github.com/learnrelay/) & [Learn Apollo](https://github.com/learnapollo) and an [Android course](https://github.com/marktani/android-workshop).

* I reviewed the [How to GraphQL](https://www.howtographql.com/) project and made large contributions to Prisma's [documentation](https://www.prisma.io/docs) and [blog](https://www.prisma.io/blog/).

* I was the MC at [GraphQL Day Amsterdam 2018](https://medium.com/graphqlconf/graphql-day-in-amsterdam-on-april-14-dee87bd9fc21) and guided hundreds of attendees through the one day conference.

* I finished my master degree in Computer Science at Karlsruhe Institute for Technology. My master thesis is **On the security of [verifiable random functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Verifiable_random_function)** in the field of cryptography.

* Languages open doors to new worlds. Therefore, I am very interested in **Language Learning**. At [Language Learners Club](https://languagelearners.club/), I was building tools for everyone who's learning a new language.


## Achievements

In early 2020, I supported [rideOS](https://rideos.ai) in growing their newly established **partner engineering** team in San Francisco, and eventually became the first partner engineer in their new Berlin office. **I am fully responsible for the success and happiness of all our partners in the EMEA region**.

Previously, I was the first employee at [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) (formerly [Graphcool](https://www.graph.cool/)), where I worked for almost 3 years. As such, I made major contributions to the company's culture, growth, and success - leading to a [$12M Series A funding](https://www.prisma.io/blog/prisma-raises-series-a-saks1zr7kip6).

As the Developer Success Lead I was fully responsible for **leading the developer success team**. This included ensuring the happiness of 100k+ developers that were using Prisma and surrounding tools, feeding customer insights to the product, engineering and marketing teams and discussing company-wide strategy and decision making with the CEO and CTO.

During my time at Prisma I grew and maintained an active and supportive community in various channels (12k+ stars on [Github](https://github.com/prisma/prisma), 10k+ users in [Slack](https://slack.prisma.io/), 2k+ users in the [Forum](https://www.prisma.io/forum/)). Besides community management, I was also fully responsible for all **customer and community related services**, which included reactive customer support and proactive customer success.

With my significant involvement in **product management**, I was assuring the quality of Prisma, as well as all surrounding products. This included project management, providing feedback on functionality and usability, and bug triaging.
